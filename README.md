# Digital-Filters
8th semester (Jan 2017 - Jun 2017)

Series of projects to:
- Learn how to design adaptive linear filters to remove undesired parts of a signal like noise distortion
- Understand the conditions for correct operation (convergence).

## Project#1 - Noise Cancellation

Language: MATLAB

## Project#3 - Periodic Interference Cancellation without reference signal

Language: MATLAB

## Project#4 - Echo Cancellation
MATLAB code was given that implements the pipeline of the Non Local Means algorithm for image denoising. Our task was to improve its performance using CUDA.

Language: MATLAB
